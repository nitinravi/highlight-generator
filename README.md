# Sport highlight generation


## Problem Statement
Publishing highlights after a sports game is a mandatory practice followed in the broadcast industry. A highlights video provides a quick snapshot of the event highlighting the interesting events in the game and thus provides the viewers an opportunity to get a quick summary of the game.

In a manual process, a video editor has to run through the entire game, identify candidate areas for the highlights and compile all the clips into a single compilation video. This can be a cumbersome process and a time-consuming.

Use AI enabled methods to automatically generate highlights data feed from an input video file. The expected output data feed may contain start/end time stamps of interesting clips from the given video feed. For example, for a cricket game the clips may contain fall of wickets, exceptional fielding, batsman hitting boundaries etc.
